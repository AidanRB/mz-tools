  ## labels
  Creating labels for laptops can be a pain, requiring Word documents or other templates. This page is designed to simplify the process.
  
  To use it, click on the label you wish to use and type/scan the service tag. More pages can be added or removed with the + and - at the top right. When you would like to print the sheet, click the print button at the top right.  
  To create labels in bulk (in lieu of a mail merge):
  - Click the download icon on the right hand side to get a CSV template.
  - Enter your data in the downloaded CSV.
  - Click the upload button to upload the modified CSV.

  ***Make sure to open the More Options dropdown and set the print margins to None***, otherwise the labels will not line up with the printed page.
